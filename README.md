NOTE: as of June 17, 2023, the latest version is [`0.5.3`](https://github.com/fanfare/googleimagesrestored/releases/0.5.3/) which fixes some new bugs - the version currently in the chrome web store is not caught up yet, it should be available on there hopefully within a few days.

### Overview

This extension attempts to make Google Images look and feel like it did before they changed everything on August 6th, 2019.

Note: in mid-2022, Google got rid of the normal "search by image" results and replaced it with "Google Lens" results. If you want to revert it back to how it used to be, please use the extension [Disable Google Lens](https://github.com/fanfare/disablegooglelens) as well.
